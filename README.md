This was one of my first project which i really enjoyed. The only problem that i had with is the sass files. I couldnt install it
propperly so i couldnt "finished" all my work (Im using Windows 10, ive searched on  the internet to find answers but didnt worked out, ill try it again but this is all i can give to you guys right now). But still, it was really fun. Cant wait to do another project like this.
Thanks!
